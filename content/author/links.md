## Absolute Links
Absolute links start with `https://`.
Absolute links are great for moving the browser to 
another website. Here's the Markdown you 
would enter for an absolute link to SuttaCentral:

<pre>[SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net)</pre>

To open up a new browser page and leave this website, 
click [SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net)

## Relative Links
A relative link leads back to your own website.
While absolute links start with `https://`,
relative links start with `/`.
Relative links are valuable when you want the viewer to stay
on your website when following the link.
In addition, if someone uses your own EBT-site as a template,
then the viewers of the copied site will stay on that website.

For example, we can use the following Markdown to stay on this site:

<pre>[SN12.23](/suttas?search=sn12.23)</pre>


Stay on this website when clicking [SN12.23](/suttas?search=sn12.23/en)
