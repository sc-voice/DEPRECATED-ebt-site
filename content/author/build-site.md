Small Buddhist communities often need a website for
coordinating activities and studies while providing
accessing to shared Dhamma.
Create your own Early Buddhist Text website based
on the Pali Canon and its translations hosted on
[SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net) 
as well as
[Voice.suttacentral.net](https://voice.suttacentral.net).

### Step 1. Create a Github account
Each EBT website is hosted on Github. To create your own EBT website, you
will need to [create a Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github). Although Github does sell products,
they are generously supporting open-source free of charge.
All EBT websites are [open source](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

### Step 2. Fork EBT-Site repository
To create your own EBT website, you will 
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
The `ebt-site` Github repository.
Your own EBT website will initially have the name 'ebt-site`,
but we'll change it later.

1. Login to Github
1. Navigate your browser to [ebt-site](https://github.com/sc-voice/ebt-site)
1. Click <kbd>Fork</kbd> in the upper right hand corner of the web page.

### Step 3. Build your EBT website
Once you have created your ebt-site fork, 
Github still needs a little push in order to start building your new EBT website. For this purpose you can make any edit on any page of your new repository.

Open the `content` folder in your repository. There you find various sub-folders. Choose any file in any of those to make any small edit. Just changing one character is enough. Committing your change will start a workflow run. Click the `Actions` tab in the top-center of your web page to see what's happening. After about 5 minutes, you'll see that the initial commit 
has been built. (It will be called whatever you call your commit.)

### Step 4. Enable Github Pages
Your EBT website will be a [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/).
Let's make it.

1. Click <kbd>Settings</kbd>
1. Scroll down to *Github Pages*
1. Select the *Source* of your Github page to be the `gh-pages` branch.
1. Click <kbd>Save</kbd>

It takes a while to build an EBT site. 
Eventually you will see a green box:

![site-published](./site-published.png)

Click on the link in the green box to view your new EBT website.

### Step 5. Enable Scheduled Actions
EBT websites get the latest documentation and Dhamma content
from their parent EBT website.
To enable content updates, we need to enable the _schedule-actions_ workflow.

1. Click on the Github icon in the upper right of your screen
1. Select the <kbd>Actions</kbd> tab
1. Click <kbd>schedule-actions</kbd>
1. Click <kbd>Enable workflow</kbd>

### Next Steps
Congratulations! You now have your own EBT website.

The following steps are optional:

* [rename your website](/author/rename-website)
* [customize your website](/author/customize-website)
