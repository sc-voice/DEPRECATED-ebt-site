Small Buddhist communities often need a website for
coordinating activities and studies while providing
accessing to shared Dhamma.
Create your own Early Buddhist Text website based
on the Pali Canon and its translations hosted on
[SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net) 
as well as
[Voice.suttacentral.net](https://voice.suttacentral.net).

### Step 1. Create a Github account
Each EBT website is hosted on Github. To create your own EBT website, you
will need to [create a Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github). Although Github does sell products,
they are generously supporting open-source free of charge.
All EBT websites are [open source](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

### Step 2. Fork EBT-Site repository
To create your own EBT website, you will 
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
The `ebt-site` Github repository.
Your own EBT website will initially have the name 'ebt-site`,
but we'll change it later.

1. Login to Github
1. Navigate your browser to [ebt-site](https://github.com/sc-voice/ebt-site)
1. Click <kbd>Fork</kbd> in the upper right hand corner of the web page.

### Step 3. Build your EBT website
Once you have created your ebt-site fork, 
Github will automatically
start building your own EBT website. 
Click the `Actions` tab in the top-center of your web page to see what's
happening. After about 5 minutes, you'll see that the initial commit 
has been built.

### Step 4. Enable Github Pages
Your EBT website will be a (Github Page](https://pages.github.com/).
Let's make it.

1. Click <kbd>Settings</kbd>
1. Scroll down to *Github Pages*
1. Select the *Source* of your Github page to be the `gh-pages` branch.
1. Click <kbd>Save</kbd>

It takes a while to build an EBT site. 
Eventually you will see a green box:

Click on the link in the green box to view your new EBT website.
