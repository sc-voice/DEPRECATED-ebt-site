## Markdown
EBT website wikis are written using
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).

NOTE: The Markdown processor used by EBT websites 
has less features than Gihub Markdown but
supports HTML5 elements.

## HTML5
You can include many HTML5 elements such as `<audio>` on your
EBT site wiki pages

## CSS
The CSS file used by your EBT website is in the `assets/svs.css` file.
CSS changes are best done using a [Linux development environment](http://localhost:3000/ebt-site/author/linux-install).

## Emojis
Copy emojis from [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/red-heart/).
For example, here is a red heart:
