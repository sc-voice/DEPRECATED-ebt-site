There are several ways to edit your EBT website wiki:

* Edit with Github (easy)
* Edit with Linux (advanced)

### Github
Each wiki page is stored as a file in your Github repository.
Github provides an online editor that
lets you add/remove/edit individual files.
Once you commit your changes to a file, Github
will automatically rebuild your website in 5-10 minutes.

To edit any wiki page on Github, simply click on the <span class="v-btn__content" style="display:inline"><span aria-hidden="true" class="v-icon notranslate theme--light"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" role="img" aria-hidden="true" class="v-icon__svg"><path d="M10 20H6V4H13V9H18V12.1L20 10.1V8L14 2H6C4.9 2 4 2.9 4 4V20C4 21.1 4.9 22 6 22H10V20M20.2 13C20.3 13 20.5 13.1 20.6 13.2L21.9 14.5C22.1 14.7 22.1 15.1 21.9 15.3L20.9 16.3L18.8 14.2L19.8 13.2C19.9 13.1 20 13 20.2 13M20.2 16.9L14.1 23H12V20.9L18.1 14.8L20.2 16.9Z"></path></svg></span></span> to the right of the title.

Although convenient, editing your files on Github
can be inefficient when making many changes.

### Linux
The advantage of editing your content on your own computer
with Linux is that it's easy to make extensive changes
rapidly. 
Reviewing an EBT website change on your own computer 
with Linux is almost instantaneous.

Unfortunately, this does require a knowledge of Linux.
Teaching Linux is beyond the scope of this documentation
so familiarity with Linux is a prerequisite for
Linux content authoring.
